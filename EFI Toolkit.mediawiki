'''The [[EDKII_EADK]] is replacing the EFI Toolkit.  It is recommended that you use this EDK II Project instead of the EFI Toolkit since it is no longer supported.'''

== Unmaintained project for reference only ==


The EFI Toolkit is a set of tools that support rapid porting and development of EFI applications, and promote a uniform pre-boot environment on 32 and 64 bit based platforms. The components are released as reference source code. Some components are meant to be stand alone and run on UEFI/EFI compliant systems and some components will require running on the EFI shell. The EFI Toolkit is released under the [[BSD License from Intel|BSD License]], and the Python code is released under [http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/license/ PSF License]. 


Working with the EFI Toolkit 

The EFI Toolkit package enables rapid development of EFI based applications, protocols, device drivers, EFI shells, and OS loaders on IA-32, IA-64(IPF) and Intel 64(EM64T or X64) platforms. It provides libraries and samples for using native EFI services, as well as portability libraries that make it easy to port or write Unix/POSIX style programs.
