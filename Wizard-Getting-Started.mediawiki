== Installation Overview ==
''Note: examples are based on Microsoft Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008. Please review the release notes for installation on other OS/compiler environments''

# Make sure you have a compiler installed that supports UDK2010.SR1
# Download the UDK2010.SR1 Driver Developer Release ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/edk2/files/UDK2010%20Releases/UDK2010.SR1/UDK2010.SR1.IHV.zip/download UDK2010.SR1.IHV]) and configure in a workspace directory (example: C:\FW\SR1.IHV)
# Download and install the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/edk2/files/EDK%20II%20Releases/Driver_Developer/UefiDriverWizard.msi/download UEFI Driver Wizard]
# Open the UEFI Driver Wizard, select 'File -> Open Workspace' and select the UDK2010.SR1.IHV workspace directory

After these steps are complete, the UEFI Driver Wizard is ready to use for the first time.

== Configure the Workspace ==

The UEFI Driver Wizard requires a subset of UDK2010 or EDK II setup before running the wizard. The [http://sourceforge.net/projects/edk2/files/UDK2010%20Releases/UDK2010.SR1/UDK2010.SR1.IHV.zip/download UDK2010.SR1 Driver Developer Release] contains the minimal set of components needed to create UEFI drivers. Please refer to the [[UDK2010.SR1.IHV Setup Guide]] for more information.

After starting the UEFI Driver Wizard, use the 'File -> Open Workspace' option to select the workspace directory (example: C:\FW\SR1.IHV).

''Note that edksetup.bat or edksetup.sh must be run in the workspace directory prior to using the UEFI Driver Wizard. The EDK II configuration files in the Conf directory are used by the UEFI Driver Wizard to detect a valid workspace. If edksetup has not been run in the workspace directory the UEFI Driver Wizard will return an error.''

== Create a Blank Driver ==

Once the workspace directory has been configured, use the 'New UEFI Driver' dialog to create a blank driver in the workspace directory.

Note that the wizard may return an error at the end of the process if required fields are left blank (example: UEFI Driver Name). For details on this dialog, please refer to the New UEFI Driver Dialog page.
