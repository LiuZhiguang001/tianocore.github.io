Within our [EDK II](http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/) project, we have various packages (each sub-directory).  To discuss an issue with a package, or to [[contribute|Code Contributions]] a code change, please consult with the package maintainer on the relevant [[mailing list|Mailing_Lists]].

The package maintainers are documented in the
[Maintainers.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianocore/edk2/master/Maintainers.txt)
file in the root of the EDK II tree.
