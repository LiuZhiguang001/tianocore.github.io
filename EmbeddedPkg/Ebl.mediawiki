=== How to delete an environement variable ===
The EBL command 'set' can be used to set an ASCII string value to a UEFI environment variable (eg: 'set myvariable myvalue').
But this command can also be used to unset a variable by typing:
<pre>
set myvariable
</pre>
This line deletes the UEFI environment variable myvariable.
