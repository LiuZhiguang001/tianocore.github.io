[[Category:EDK]]
The '''EDK''' is the open-source component of the "Framework", Intel's implementation of the EFI Specification, which was developed under the project codenamed "Tiano". The EDK was released under the  [[BSD License]]. Refer to the  [[FAQ#EDK_and_Fat-Driver_Projects_FAQ|EDK  section of the EFI and Framework Open Source FAQs]]  for a full explanation of how the EDK relates to the EFI effort.


=='''Working with the EDK'''==

The EDK is essentially a container for the Framework's Foundation code and sample drivers. The EDK is also a development kit for developing, debugging, and testing EFI and Framework drivers, EFI Option ROMs, and EFI Applications for use in the Framework environment. To download snapshots of development or official release of the EDK, click on the link and choose the release to start the download process.  Download the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/efidevkit/files/Edk%20Getting%20Started%20Guide%5B1%5D.0.41.pdf/download EDK Getting Started Guide] (pdf) for guidance on building and using the EDK to develop and test drivers.  The [http://www.intel.com/technology/framework/spec.htm Framework Specification] on the Intel website.  To learn more about the EDK codebase see the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=Modules EDK Module Structure Explained].
