**GitHub EDK II Project Repositories**
--------------------------------------

The EDK II project repository is available at
<https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>.

Prebuilt Windows tools are available at
<https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32>.

Please note that FatPkg is not included in the EDKII project repository,
it is an independent repository which can be found at
<https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg>.

Content that is not released under an accepted open source license can
be found at <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-non-osi>.

**How to Setup the EDK II Tree**
--------------------------------

**Note:** Some of the following examples use the Multiple Workspace
feature to configure the EDK II BaseTools. More information on the
Multiple Workspace feature can be found at the following location.

-   [Multiple\_Workspace](Multiple_Workspace "wikilink")

### **Linux Support**

#### For EDKII project developers:

-   Clone the EDK II project repository
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>
-   Change to the edk2 directory
-   Build the tools
    -   make -C BaseTools
-   Run the edksetup.sh script
    -   . edksetup.sh

When the above steps are done, you can work in the edk2 directory for
code development.

#### For FatPkg developers:

-   Create a workspace directory
-   Change to the workspace directory
-   Clone the EDK II project repository
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>
-   Clone the edk2-FatPkg repository to “FatPkg”
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg> FatPkg
-   Build the tools
    -   make -C edk2/BaseTools
-   Set environment variables
    -   WORKSPACE – The workspace directory created above
    -   PACKAGES\_PATH – Set it to \$WORKSPACE/edk2

Example:

```
export WORKSPACE=/Sample/Path
export PACKAGES_PATH=$WORKSPACE/edk2
```

-   Run the edksetup.sh script
    -   . edk2/edksetup.sh

When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:

```
 Sample
   └───Path (WORKSPACE)
      ├───edk2
      └───FatPkg
```

### **Windows Support**

#### For EDKII project developers:

-   Create a workspace directory
-   Change to the workspace directory
-   Clone the EDK II project repository
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>
-   Clone the edk2-BaseTools-win32 repository
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32>
-   Set environment variables:
    -   EDK\_TOOLS\_BIN – Set it as the edk2-BaseTools-win32 directory

Example:

`   set EDK_TOOLS_BIN=c:\efi\test\edk2-BaseTools-win32`

-   Change to the edk2 directory
-   Run the edksetup.bat script

When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:

```
 efi
   └───test (WORKSPACE)
      ├───edk2
      └───edk2-BaseTools-win32
```

#### For FatPkg developers:

-   Create a workspace directory
-   Change to the workspace directory
-   Clone the EDK II project repository
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>
-   Clone the edk2-BaseTools-win32 repository
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32>
-   Clone the edk2-FatPkg repository to “FatPkg”
    -   git clone <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg> FatPkg
-   Set environment variables:
    -   WORKSPACE – The workspace directory created above
    -   PACKAGES\_PATH – Set it to %WORKSPACE%\\edk2
    -   EDK\_TOOLS\_BIN – Set it to %WORKSPACE%\\edk2-BaseTools-win32

Example:

```
set WORKSPACE=c:\efi\test
set PACKAGES_PATH=%WORKSPACE%\edk2
set EDK_TOOLS_BIN=%WORKSPACE%\edk2-BaseTools-win32
```

-   Run the edksetup.bat script
    -   edk2\\edksetup.bat

When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:

```
efi
  └───test (WORKSPACE)
     ├───edk2
     ├───edk2-BaseTools-win32
     └───FatPkg
```

Please keep in mind that the EDK II project, FatPkg and
edk2-BaseTools-win32 are independent Git repositories. Each of these
repositories must be updated individually.
