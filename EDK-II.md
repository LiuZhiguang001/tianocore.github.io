## Stable Tags

Stable tags are created from `edk2/master` based on validation with various platforms. Stable tags names use
the format `edk2-stable<4 digit year><2 digit month>` and occur roughly every three months (starting from August 2018).

## UDK Releases

UEFI Development Kit ([[UDK]]) releases of EDK II are based on validation using various platforms. The year tag indicates the year of major specifications used for the release. UDK releases pre-date the introduction of the stable tag, occur less frequently, and have a longer validation cycle.
