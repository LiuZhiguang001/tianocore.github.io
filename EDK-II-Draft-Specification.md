  + This document describes the EDK II Declaration (DEC) file format. This format 
    was designed to support building packaging and distribution of EDK II modules,
    as well as for building platforms and modules using the EDK II build infrastructure.
    EDK II declaration files may be created during installation of a distribution that
    follows the UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification. They 
    may also be created manually.  The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation
    of UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4 (Unified EFI, Inc.) compliant binary images.
