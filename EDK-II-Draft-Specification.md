\] This document describes the EDK II Declaration (DEC) file format. This format 
was designed to support building packaging and distribution of EDK II modules,
as well as for building platforms and modules using the EDK II build infrastructure.
EDK II declaration files may be created during installation of a distribution that
follows the UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification. They 
may also be created manually.  The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation
of UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4 (Unified EFI, Inc.) compliant binary images.

\] This document describes the EDK II build information (INF) file format. This format 
supports the new build requirements of build EDK components and EDK II modules within
the EDK II build infrastructure. The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of
binary images that comply with Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure
(PI) 1.4 specifications.
