\] This document describes the EDK II Build Architecture. This specification was
designed to support new build requirements for building EDK II modules and EDK
components within the EDK II build infrastructure as well as to generate binary
firmware images and Unified Extensible Firmware Image (UEFI) applications.

* **_EDK II DEC Specification_** \[

[GitHub ](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/edk2-DecSpecification)
\] This document describes the EDK II Declaration (DEC) file format. This format 
was designed to support building packaging and distribution of EDK II modules,
as well as for building platforms and modules using the EDK II build infrastructure.
EDK II declaration files may be created during installation of a distribution that
follows the UEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification. They 
may also be created manually.  The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation
of UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4 (Unified EFI, Inc.) compliant binary images.

* **_EDK II INF Specification_** \[

[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-inf-specification),
[GitHub ](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/edk2-InfSpecification)
\] This document describes the EDK II build information (INF) file format. This format 
supports the new build requirements of build EDK components and EDK II modules within
the EDK II build infrastructure. The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of
binary images that comply with Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure
(PI) 1.4 specifications.

* **_EDK II DSC Specification_** \[
[HTML   ](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-dsc-specification),

[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-dsc-specification/details),
[GitHub ](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/edk2-DscSpecification)
\] This document describes the EDK II Platform Description file (DSC) format. The EDK Build Tools
are included as part of the EDK II compatibility package. In order to use EDK II Modules or the
EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF file must be used. EDK II tools use INI style text based
files to describe components, platforms and firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the
EDK II DSC file format is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these files.
The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply with Unified EFI
(UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4 specifications.

* **_EDK II FDF Specification_** \[
[HTML   ](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-fdf-specification),

[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-fdf-specification),
[GitHub ](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/edk2-FdfSpecification)
\] This document describes the EDK II Flash Description (FDF) file format. This format was
designed to support new build requirements of building EDK and EDK II modules within the
EDK II build infrastructure. The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation of current
Unified EFI, Inc. (UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4) compliant binary images. The FDF file is used to
describe the content and layout of binary images. Binary images described in this file may
be any combination of boot images, capsule images or PCI Options ROMs.

[GitHub ](https://github.com/tianocore-docs/edk2-VfrSpecification)
\] To simplify the creation of Internal Forms Representation (IFR), a high-level Visual Forms
Representation (VFR) language is described in this document. Using this language syntax, a
compiler can be designed to take an ordinary text file containing VFR as an input, and output
IFR for use in a userâ€™s program. There are various methods to define the VFR language.

* **_EDK II Meta-Data Expression Syntax Specification_** \[
[HTML   ](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/edk2-docs/edk-ii-meta-data-expression-syntax-specification),
