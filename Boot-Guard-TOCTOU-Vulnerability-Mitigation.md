Boot Guard TOCTOU Vulnerability Mitigation
========
A security vulnerability was discovered (CVE-2019-11098 - [BZ 1614](https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614))
in EDK II firmware that allows an attacker with physical access to achieve code execution after the Intel&reg; Boot Guard
ACM computes and validates the hash of the Initial Boot Block (IBB) and firmware measurements have been extended into the
TPM PCR0. This means the firmware will be considered valid and PCR0 will have expected values even though unsigned code
has executed. By using targeted SPI transactions to modify IBB code after the IBB image is verified in CPU LLC, the
modified code may later be fetched from SPI flash and executed.

**This attack requires physical access to the SPI flash.**

# Background
Intel&reg; Boot Guard is a technology which establishes a strong component based Static Root of Trust for verification
and measurement (S-CRTV/S-CRTM). Protection is provided against malicious modification of the Initial Boot Block (IBB).
The IBB in this context refers to the initial "BIOS" boot block code provided by the platform manufacturer that is
verified by the ACM. The ACM places the CPU into Non-Eviction Mode (NEM) and reads the IBB into the CPU LLC. The
verification and/or measurement of the IBB will occur on the image in the CPU LLC. Eventually, IBB execution begins when
ACM jumps to the IBB entry point.

In terms of Platform Initialization (PI) specification terminology, IBB execution begins in the SEC phase and eventually
reaches the PEI phase where permanent memory (i.e. DRAM) is initialized. All of the code executed up to and including
the memory initialization code is from the CPU LLC operating in NEM. Throughout the boot execution flow in NEM, pointers
are typically stored in global data structures (such as the HOB list or PPI database) or behind architecturally defined
interfaces such as the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) or Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).

The addresses stored in these global areas during NEM execution refer to content verified and/or measured by ACM or
modified by a trusted code component in IBB. After permanent memory is initialized, the IBB will read subsequent
portions of firmware code into permanent memory and verify and/or measure the code according to boot policy to continue
a chain of trust. However, in order to use the cache in a normal hierarchical caching mode, NEM must be disabled and
the cache will be flushed in the process. Global software structures such as the HOB list and PPI database that were
maintained in the heap in Temporary RAM are migrated by the PEI Foundation to permanent memory before the
general module dispatch process begins in permanent memory. However, the code in the PEI Foundation today will only
"migrate" (i.e. convert pointers from a Temporary RAM location to the corresponding permanent memory location) pointers
for known code structures (e.g. defined in the UEFI specification or PI specification) in the Temporary RAM heap and
Temporary RAM stack. There's a large set of pointers to locations that were in Cache-As-RAM (CAR) whose pointers are
not updated. If the system firmware flash ROM is stored on a SPI flash device, the addresses map 1:1 to the original
contents in cache via SPI flash MMIO. This means the code is accessible for functionality but it will result in a read
to SPI flash whereas the verified copy in CPU LLC should be used instead.

In order to mitigate this vulnerability, global pointers into CAR addresses must not exist (and certainly not
dereferenced) after NEM is disabled. Those resources must be moved from CAR to permanent memory and any global pointer
references must be updated. In this mitigation, the process of performing these actions is referred to as "migration".

# Platform Guidance for the Mitigation Changes Provided
The changes described in this mitigation are intended to simply integrate into firmware solutions. For the changes to
function as intended, the platform firmware implementation should follow these guidelines.

1. Always ensure PcdMigrateTemporaryRamFirmwareVolumes is set to TRUE
   if Boot Guard is enabled and V=1 or M=1.
2. Ensure that all PEIMs are relocatable. Relocation tables should
   not be stripped.
3. If an Intel&reg; Firmware Support Package (FSP) binary solution is
   used, the binary must have these mitigation changes integrated.
4. Avoid maintaining pointers to pre-memory addresses inside embedded
   structures or other non-standard structures that the automatic
   migration code introduced in this change cannot identify.
5. Migrate the FIT table based on platform requirements for FIT
   access in post-memory.
6. Add the SecMigrationPei.inf component to migrate the pointer from
   the SEC phase.

Notes: IBB will be set Not Present, you will see a page fault if any code access to the IBB region after migration.
       the address where the code access can be identified in the CR2 register.

# High-Level Migration Required
Resources that must be migrated can be categorized as code or data.

## Code Migration
Code pointers are typically registered during pre-memory execution so they are available for invocation later in the
boot flow such as PPIs or callbacks that will be invoked upon some future event (e.g. PPI notification).

The following code pointers are addressed in the current mitigation posting:
* PEIM-to-PEIM Interfaces (PPIs)
* PEI notifications
* Reset callback handlers
* Status code callback handlers

## PEI Convert Pointer PPI
A new PPI is introduced in these mitigation changes that is published by the PEI Foundation to provide a pointer
conversion service for pointers to firmware volumes in pre-memory that are not migrated by the PEI Foundation. This
PPI is only published when PcdMigrateTemporaryRamFirmwareVolumes is set to TRUE.

## PEIM-to-PEIM Interfaces (PPIs) and PEI Notifications
Modules that produce PPIs can register for shadow using the PEI Services which make the PEI Foundation call into the
module's entry point after permanent memory is initialized. Once relocated in permanent memory, the module can use the
`ReinstallPpi ()` API defined in the Platform Initialization (PI) specification to reinstall the PPI with a GUID and
interface structure in permanent memory. In practice, this is tedious and error prone so a generic PPI migration
solution is introduced in this mitigation to automatically migrate PPIs installed under conditions that allow migration.
The migration process occurs during PEI Core shadow, before permanent memory module dispatch beings. A similar reinstall
service does not exist for PEI notifications, however must be migrated and can be handled in a similar way to PPIs.

If the PPI descriptor address is not within a PEIM that is in an installed FV (in the PEI Foundation's FV list) or the
Temporary RAM heap/stack, this mitigation solution will not be able to automatically migrate the PPI. In this case, the
PEIM that installed the PPI must re-install the PPI. Furthermore, if the PPI interface structure is stored in a
dynamically allocated memory buffer, this mitigation solution will not be able to automatically migrate the pointers
in the structure.

The pointers known to the PEI Foundation (e.g. defined in MdePkg/Include/Pi/PiPeiCis.h) are updated during migration
because the offset from the Temporary RAM heap/stack and permanent memory heap/stack are known to the PEI Foundation.
Similarly, the offset from the Temporary RAM FV and corresponding permanent memory FV is known to the PEI Foundation.
Other pointers (such as static function pointers in a PPI interface structure) rely upon the PE32/COFF address fixup
done using a relocation table during the FV migration support introduced in this mitigation change. If the addresses
are not statically calculated in the image, such as those placed in a buffer allocated with `AllocatePool ()`, the
module must manually update the pointers to the permanent memory location.

## Reset Callbacks and Status Code Callbacks
Reset callback and status code callback functions can be registered by PEIMs throughout the boot. These callbacks are
registered outside the PEI Foundation so the PEIMs that provide the registration service use the PEI Convert Pointer
PPI service to convert the function addresses to permanent memory addresses.

## Data Migration
Global data pointers are inherent in the system architecture in addition to firmware implementation.

Pointers to the following data structures are addressed in the current mitigation posting:
* Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
   * Migrated in CpuMpPei
* Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
   * Migrated in SecCore (SecTemporaryRamDone ())
* PEI Services table pointer
   * Migrated in PeiCore
* Temporary RAM (T-RAM) heap and stack
   * Migrated in PeiCore (or TemporaryRamMigration ())
* PPI list pointer
   * Migrated in PeiCore
* Hand Off Block (HOB) list pointer
   * Migrated in PeiCore
* Memory allocation HOB entries
   * Migrated in PeiCore
* Firmware Volume (FV) HOB entries
   * Migrated in PeiCore

# Verifying Migration
Several mechanisms are introduced to simplify checking the migration of code and data resources.

## Catching Invalid Accesses
In order to catch an access to a verified IBB range after NEM is disabled, a page table may be set up in post-memory
PEI that marks the IBB range as Not Present. This causes a page fault which allows the user to quickly identify the
address that was accessed and caused the issue by inspecting the value in the CR2 register.

In the example exception handler print message, code execution was attempted at the invalid address 0xFFF75630. An
address map may be used to map that address to a specific function.

## Debug Print Messages
In a DEBUG build, messages will be printed to the DEBUG output that show before and after migration details. Some
examples of those output are shown below to aid in finding the messages in DEBUG output.

Many of the debug print messages are defined as DEBUG_VERBOSE. To see these messages, set
BIT22 ("Detailed debug message") in the PCDs PcdFixedDebugPrintErrorLevel / PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel. This should
specifically be set for PeiCore, CpuMpPei, and the module that FirmwareInterfaceTableLib is linked against (if used).
