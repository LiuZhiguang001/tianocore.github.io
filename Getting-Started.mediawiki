'''FYI for Add-in Hardware Developers'''

* See [[Driver Developer|UEFI Driver Developer Resources with EDK II]] Support UEFI driver development by independent hardware vendors (IHV), including the UEFI Driver Wizard and UEFI Driver Writers Guide (DWG).


* Both [[EDK]] and [[EDK-II |EDK II]] contain a Developerâ€™s UEFI Emulation ([[DuetPkg]]) environment to aid in development of UEFI drivers for add-in hardware.  One of the limitations of the [[NT32]] emulation environment is the inability to communicate directly with hardware.  This is of particular concern to add-in hardware developers (IHVs), who are developing UEFI drivers for their hardware devices.
