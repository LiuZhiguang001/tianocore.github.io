Define a structure that enables developers to consistently navigate source code, execution flow, and the functional results of bootstrapping a system; 2. Enable a minimal platform where minimal is defined as the minimal firmware implementation required to produce a basic solution that can be further extended to meet a multitude of client, server, and embedded market needs; 3. Minimize coupling between common, silicon, platform, and board packages; 4. Enable large granularity binary solutions.  A key aspect of these objectives is to improve the transparency and security quality across client, server, and embedded ecosystems.
