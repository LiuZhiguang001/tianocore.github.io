<!-- [[Category:EDKII Packages]] -->

==Status==
The goal of this project is to provide a common OS emulation environment, to replace [[Nt32Pkg]] and [[UnixPkg]].

{| class='wikitable'
! UEFI architecture || Operating System || Status
|-
| IA32 || Unix || Functional
|-
| IA32 || Windows || Not started
|-
| X64 || Unix || Functional
|-
| X64 || Windows || Not started
|}

==How to Build & Run==

 $ EmulatorPkg/build.sh
 $ EmulatorPkg/build.sh run

The build architecture will match your host machine's architecture.

On X64 host machines, you can build + run IA32 mode as well:
 $ EmulatorPkg/build.sh -a IA32
 $ EmulatorPkg/build.sh -a IA32 run

===Ubuntu build dependencies===
