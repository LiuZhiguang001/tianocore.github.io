=== Change Notice ===
We will be moving our edk2-devel mailing list to Groups.io on April 3rd, 2019 (Pacific Time Zone). You will need to subscribe to this list to continue to receive emails. There is also a new edk2-announce list. Finally, the edk2-bugs mailing list will migrate sometime in the future, after the edk2-devel transition is complete.

Some smaller projects do not have separate emails lists.  In this case, feel free to discuss these projects on either the EDK or EDK II developer discussions email lists.
