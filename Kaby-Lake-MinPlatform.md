[devel-MinPlatform](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/devel-MinPlatform) is the EDK II project for UEFI platform firmware on 7th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors and chipsets (formerly [Kaby Lake](https://ark.intel.com/products/codename/82879/Kaby-Lake) platforms.

This tree follows a "minimum platform" philosophy, providing boot to a UEFI compliant operating system using the minimum number of EDK II modules. The project uses the [Intel® Firmware Support Package (Intel® FSP)](https://github.com/IntelFsp/FSP/tree/Kabylake) for platform silicon initialization.
