EDK II Standard Libraries and Applications

The EADK (uEfi Application Development Kit) provides a set of standards-based libraries, along with utility and demonstration applications, intended to ease development of UEFI applications based upon the EDK II Open-Source distribution.

At this time, applications developed with the EADK are intended to reside on, and be loaded from, storage separate from the core firmware.  This is primarily due to size and environmental requirements.

This release of the EADK should only be used to produce UEFI Applications.  Due to the execution environment built by the StdLib component, execution as a UEFI driver can cause system stability issues.
