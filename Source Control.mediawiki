<!-- [[Category:EDKII]] -->

Subversion is currently the primary source control system we use.  However, as each individual project may choose its own source control system, you should refer to the project's page to find the official source control location.

==Mirrors==

In a few cases, some source control mirrors are available.  However, these mirrors are '''not''' officially supported.
