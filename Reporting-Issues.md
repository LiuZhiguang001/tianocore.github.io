### Tianocore Bugzilla

The bug tracking system used for Tianocore projects is [Tianocore Bugzilla](https://tianocore.acgmultimedia.com).  Issues can be viewed without an account.  An account must be [created](https://tianocore.acgmultimedia.com/createaccount.cgi) to enter new issues or update exiting issues.  Additional information about Bugzilla can be found at:
* [Bugzilla Web Site](https://www.bugzilla.org/)
* [Bugzilla User's Guide](https://bugzilla.readthedocs.io/en/5.0/using/index.html)

Developers can also choose to sign up to the [edk2-bugs@lists.01.org](https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/edk2-bugs) mailing list to receive an emails each time a new issue is entered or an exiting issue is updated.

Tianocore issues can be entered using the following products and categories.

| Product                        | Category                                           |

If you believe you have discovered a security issue, then you must enter the issue using the **Tianocore Security Issues** product type.  The issue will be evaluated to determine if it really is a security issue or not.  Security Advisories and the process used to evaluate **Tianocore Security Issues** can be found in [Reporting Security Issues]({{wiki}}/Reporting Security Issues)

**NOTE:** Never send any security issue details in email.
