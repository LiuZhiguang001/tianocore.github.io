The transition of the UEFI Open Source Community Website to the new hosting (via Sourceforge), has settled down in the past weeks, and for all intents and purposes the move is complete.

During this time, there have been several new additions to the content on this website.

In the EDK II project, in the subversion repository, there have many updates and new features added to the EDK II code since the first of the year.

Also, there have been updates to much of the documentation in the EDK II project, including the General Documentation and the addition of a new folder for Technical Information.

This has been an exciting time for the UEFI Open Source Community and this website.

The administrators would like to thank the members of the community for their understanding and patience during this transition period.

### [February 5, 2010](http://www.tianocore.org/news/2010/02/05/news.html)

Site Transition – February 05, 2010 –

The use of the URL www.tianocore.org is now linked to this site (when accessed as http://, there are still some issues using https:// which are undergoing resolution).

News – February 05, 2010 –

There has been an update on the “How to Contribute” Page. The basic contributor can now submit contributions via the Developer’s discussion list for a project, rather than a contribution list. This was done to streamline the overall number of discussion groups.

### [February 2, 2010](http://www.tianocore.org/news/2010/02/02/news.html)

Site Transition – February 02, 2010 –

The original hosting for The UEFI Open Source Community Website is off line.

This site is now the operational support for the UEFI Open Source Community Website.

The projects have been transferred, and all sources are now available.

The discussion groups are still in the process of migration.

The link of the URL: Tianocore.org will be linking to this site in the near future.

### [January 21, 2010](http://www.tianocore.org/news/2010/01/21/news.html)

Site Transition – Downtime January 21, 2010 –

The original hosting for The UEFI Open Source Community Website is now locked down and will be off line soon.

This is the new hosting site.

The transition team is finishing the moves of the data (files, svn repositories, pages, etc) to this new hosted site.

You can access the data read only mode as it becomes available. We are verifying the project and its contents, so it will be a few days before write access becomes available to the site members (including discussion forums).

Please use this time to register with Sourceforge as an user, so we can expedite your access to the projects when write access becomes available on projects.

Questions can be sent directly to the administrators on this site.

Thank you,

The Administrators

### [January 14, 2010](http://www.tianocore.org/news/2010/01/14/news.html)

SITE TRANSITION—DOWNTIME January 21—Your action required

The transition of The UEFI Open Source Community Website (URL: www.tianocore.org) is underway, and the members of this community should be aware of the following events:

January 14, 2010 – This message update and Email has been posted on the website and transmitted to the UEFI Open Source Community members.

January 19, 2010 – The UEFI Open Source Community Website in its current form will be ‘Locked down’ to Read only access for the community membership. This is to provide the transfer team time and opportunity to gather content from the current site and transfer it to the new site, without updates occurring in the process.

January 21, 2010 – Will be the last day that this version of the UEFI Open Source Community Website will be available. On midnight between 01/21/2010 and 01/22/2010, the current hosting of the website will end, and the content will not be available.

January 22, 2010 – The new UEFI Open Source Community Website will be available on the new hosting site. The new hosting will be part of the Sourceforge community (sourceforge.net), and will be available through the following link:

www.tianocore.Sourceforge.net

As well as www.tianocore.org once the DNS transfer takes place. There will be a slight delay between this event and the transfer ot the DNS for the URL:www.tianocore.org to transfer from the current site to the new site, during that time, the link may appear broken. The transfer team will be focused on making this timeframe as small as possible, but please be aware that this may be the case.

The following information should answer some of the most obvious questions about this change:

\1) User accounts:

We are currently working on a process of converting the current UEFI Open Source Community Website accounts to Sourceforge compatible accounts.

ACTION REQUIRED: Before the transition, we will furnish a process for your SourceForge accounts. Please watch for this information and follow the instructions as soon as they are available.

\2) Site Content:

After January 21. 2010, the new site will have all content originally provided in the previous site. This includes SVN, Downloads, discussion groups and boards, and information pages.

Thank you,

The Administrators

### [December 9, 2009](http://www.tianocore.org/news/2009/12/09/news.html)

The UEFI Open Source Community Website (URL: www.tianocore.org) will be going through some updates and changes.

This site has been using the same format and interfaces since its inception in 2004, and it is time for an update.

These changes will not impact the functionality of the site, and the transition team is focused upon retaining all site content and context as part of the process. The administrators of this site will do everything possible to make the process as smooth and seamless as possible over the next weeks. We apologize if this process causes any difficulty for the membership of the UEFI Open Source Community website.

We will be providing news updates here as the process progresses.

Thank you,

The Administrators
