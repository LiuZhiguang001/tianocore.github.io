This page describes how the this site and associated sites work.

The goal is to document for support and enable an opensource model for managing the site.

The Tianocore project is the front end to the other projects.  Each major project is its own project at sourceforge
The Tianocore project hosts the mediawiki hosted app and the mailing list hosted app. 

if you know a better way to do this please let us know because even the site is open source  ;-)
