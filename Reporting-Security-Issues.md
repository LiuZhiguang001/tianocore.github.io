# How to report a Security Issue

Sign up for a Tianocore Bugzilla account and enter a new issue in the **Tianocore Security Issue** product.  Issues in the **Tianocore Security Issue** product are only visible to **Reporter** of the issue and the members of the **infosec** group.

# How Security Issues are Evaluated

When a Tianocore Security Issue is entered, the issue is evaluated by the **infosec** group to determine if the issue is a security issue or not.  If it is not deemed to be a security issue, then the issue is converted to a standard issue and follows the normal issue resolution process.   If the issue is confirmed to be a security issue, then the priority, severity, and impact of the issue is assessed by the **infosec** group.  Discussions, resolution, and patches are completed within Bugzilla.  A date for public disclose is determined, and on that date the issue is made public and added to the list of Security Advisories.

If you are interested in being involved in the evaluation of Tianocore Security Issues, then please send an email request to join the Tianocore Bugzilla infosec group to the Tianocore Community Manager or one of the Tianocore Stewards.

**NOTE**: Never send any details related to a security issue in email.
