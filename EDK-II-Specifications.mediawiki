EDK II FDF File Spec v1.27  DRAFT for Review- <BR>
This document describes the EDK II Flash Description (FDF) file format. This format was designed to support new build requirements of building EDK and EDK II modules within the EDK II build infrastructure.
The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation of current Unified EFI, Inc. (UEFI 2.6 and PI 1.4) compliant binary images.
The FDF file is used to describe the content and layout of binary images. Binary images described in this file may be any combination of boot images, capsule images or PCI Options ROMs.

EDK II DSC File Spec v1.26 - <br>
This document describes the EDK II Platform Description file (DSC) format. The EDK Build Tools are included as part of the EDK II compatibility package. In order to use EDK II Modules or the EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF file must be used.<br>
EDK II tools use INI style text based files to describe components, platforms and firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the EDK II DSC file format is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these files.<br>
The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply with Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4 specifications.

EDK II C Coding Standards Specification 2.1 Draft - <br>



The EDK II C Coding Standards Specification establishes a set of rules intended not as a
constraint, but as an enabling philosophy which will:
* Establish uniformity of style.
* Set minimum information content requirements.
* Allow all programmers to easily understand the code.
* Facilitate support tasks by establishing uniform conventions.
* Ease documentation efforts by embedding the design documentation in the code.
* Reduce customer and new employee learning curves by providing accurate code documentation and uniform style.

These rules apply to all code developed
