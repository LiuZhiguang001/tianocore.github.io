EDK II BUILD Spec  V1.26 - <br>
This document describes the EDK II Build Architecture. This specification was designed
to support new build requirements for building EDK II modules and EDK components
within the EDK II build infrastructure as well as to generate binary firmware images and
Unified Extensible Firmware Image (UEFI) applications.

EDK II DSC File Spec v1.26 <br>
This document describes the EDK II Platform Description file (DSC) format. The EDK Build Tools are included as part of the EDK II compatibility package. In order to use EDK II Modules or the EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF file must be used.<br>
EDK II tools use INI style text based files to describe components, platforms and firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the EDK II DSC file format is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these files.<br>
The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply with Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4 specifications.

VFR Programming Language v 1.9  <br>
To simplify the creation of Internal Forms Representation (IFR), 
a high-level Visual Forms Representation (VFR) language is
described in this document.
Using this language syntax, a compiler can be designed to take an ordinary text file containing VFR as an input, and output IFR for use in a userâ€™s program. There are various methods to define the VFR language.

EDK II C Coding Standards Specification<br>



The EDK II C Coding Standards Specification establishes a set of rules intended not as a
constraint, but as an enabling philosophy which will:
* Establish uniformity of style.
* Set minimum information content requirements.
* Allow all programmers to easily understand the code.
* Facilitate support tasks by establishing uniform conventions.
* Ease documentation efforts by embedding the design documentation in the code.
* Reduce customer and new employee learning curves by providing accurate code documentation and uniform style.

These rules apply to all code developed
