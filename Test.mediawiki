=='''GitHub EDKII Project Repositories'''==
The EDKII project repository is available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2. 

Prebuilt Windows tools are available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32.

Please note that FatPkg is not included in the EDKII project repository, it is an independent repository which can be found at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg.

=='''How to Setup the EDKII Tree'''==
==='''Linux Support'''===
For EDKII project developers:
*	Clone the EDKII project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Change to the edk2 directory
*	Build the tools
**	make -C BaseTools
*	Run the edksetup.sh script
**	. edksetup.sh
When the above steps are done, you can work in the edk2 directory for code development.


How to Setup the EDKII Tree
When creating a tree structure it is required that all paths defined by PACKAGES_PATH are subdirectories under the WORKSPACE environment variable.  This makes sure that all tool and packages references are contained within the WORKSPACE directory structure.

==='''Environment Variables:'''===
*         WORKSPACE
**    Location of the Build directory
**    Always highest search priority
*        PACKAGES_PATH
**    All paths must be under the WORKSPACE path
**   List of additional paths to search for packages using OS path separator character
**   Paths are listed in priority order

'''Example:'''
  set WORKSPACE=c:\efi\test
  set PACKAGES_PATH=%WORKSPACE%\platform;%WORKSPACE%\edk2

In this case WORKSPACE is the container for two trees as well as the location of the Build directory.  The example assumes the set of code packages for a given platform are contained in the platform directory.  While the code packages from the open source repository are contained in the edk2 directory.

When the build tools are run with this configuration the directories will be scanned in the following order to find packages listed in the DSC and FDF files.
#       c:\efi\test
#       c:\efi\test\platform
#       c:\efi\test\edk2

'''Summary:'''
*         Use of PACKAGES_PATH is not required
*         All PACKAGES_PATH entries must be subdirectories of the WORKSPACE environment variable
*         PACKAGES_PATH must be set prior to running the edksetup script for correct tool configuration
