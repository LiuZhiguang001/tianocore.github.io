# 2018 EDK II Capsule Hack-a-thon

## Overview

Part of [[OSFC 2018]] in Erlangen, Germany
https://osfc.io/
September 14-15 - times TBD

Participants are encouraged to exercise platform code related to [`SignedCapsulePkg`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/SignedCapsulePkg) and [`FmpDevicePkg`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/FmpDevicePkg) based on the [`edk2-stable201808`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable201808) stable tag release.

This is the first time Intel has staged a public TianoCore hack-a-thon event. Thanks to the OSFC organizers for providing the venue.

## Target Platforms

Test code provided is designed for the MinnowBoard Max & MinnowBoard Turbot platforms. These are open hardware platforms based on 64-bit Intel® Atom™ E3800 Series processor family. https://minnowboard.org

Intel will have 15-20 platforms on site for testing, along with support hardware (SPI flash programmers, serial-to-USB adapters, keyboards, etc.). Participants are expected to bring their own laptop systems for code compilation and debugging.

## Target Codebase

Testing will be based on a project ported to the `edk2-stable201808` tag. This code will be available in github in advance of the event (stay tuned). Since this is an updated version of `SignedCapsulePkg` and `FmpCapsulePkg`, the official MinnowBoard firmware release does not have the latest implementation.
