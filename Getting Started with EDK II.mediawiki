==Step-by-step Instructions==

We have some step-by-step instructions for helping new developers set up their build environment and build their first [[EDK II]] package.

A few different build environment types are documented.  If instructions are not available for your exact system configuration, you may still be able to tweak the instructions to work on your system.

* [[Using EDK II with Native GCC]] (Recommended when using newer versions of Linux)
* [[Windows systems]]
* [[Xcode]] (Mac OS X)
* Other [[Unix-like systems]] (For '''older''' Linux distributions, or when using Cygwin or Mac OS X)

==Tools==
If the step-by-step instructions above are not available for your environment, then you can [[install some external tools|follow these instructions]] to install the tools that are necessary to build the code.

Further instructions for using the EDK II are provided in the [http://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/edk2/trunk/edk2/BuildNotes2.txt  BuildNotes2.txt] at the top of the edk2 directory tree. This file can be displayed using the [http://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/edk2 Subversion web interface]. 

==Further Help==

If you have questions about the code or run into obstacles getting things to work for you, please join our [[edk2-devel]] email list and ask your EDK II related questions on the list.
