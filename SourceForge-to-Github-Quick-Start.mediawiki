=='''GitHub EDK II Project Repositories'''==

The EDK II project repository is available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2. <BR><BR>
Prebuilt Windows tools are available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32. <BR><BR>
Please note that FatPkg is not included in the EDKII project repository, it is an independent repository which can be found at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg.<BR><BR>

=='''How to Setup the EDK II Tree'''==
'''Note:''' Some of the following examples use the Multiple Workspace feature to configure the EDK II BaseTools.  More information on the Multiple Workspace feature can be found at the following location. <BR>
* [[Multiple_Workspace]]

==='''Linux Support'''===
====For EDKII project developers:====
*	Clone the EDK II project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Change to the edk2 directory
*	Build the tools
**	make -C BaseTools
*	Run the edksetup.sh script
**	. edksetup.sh
When the above steps are done, you can work in the edk2 directory for code development.

====For FatPkg developers:====
*	Create a workspace directory
*	Change to the workspace directory
*	Clone the EDK II project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Clone the edk2-FatPkg repository to “FatPkg”
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg FatPkg
*	Build the tools
**	make -C edk2/BaseTools
*	Set environment variables
**	WORKSPACE – The workspace directory created above
**	PACKAGES_PATH – Set it to $WORKSPACE/edk2
Example:
  export WORKSPACE=/Sample/Path
  export PACKAGES_PATH=$WORKSPACE/edk2
*	Run the edksetup.sh script
**	. edk2/edksetup.sh
When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:
  Sample
    └───Path (WORKSPACE)
       ├───edk2
       └───FatPkg

==='''Windows Support'''===
====For EDKII project developers:====
*	Create a workspace directory
*	Change to the workspace directory
*	Clone the EDK II project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Clone the edk2-BaseTools-win32 repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32
*	Set environment variables:
**	EDK_TOOLS_BIN – Set it as the edk2-BaseTools-win32 directory
Example:
    set EDK_TOOLS_BIN=c:\efi\test\edk2-BaseTools-win32

*	Change to the edk2 directory
*	Run the edksetup.bat script
When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:
  efi
    └───test (WORKSPACE)
       ├───edk2
       └───edk2-BaseTools-win32

====For FatPkg developers:====
*	Create a workspace directory
*	Change to the workspace directory
*	Clone the EDK II project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Clone the edk2-BaseTools-win32 repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32
*	Clone the edk2-FatPkg repository to “FatPkg”
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg FatPkg 
*	Set environment variables:
**	WORKSPACE – The workspace directory created above
**	PACKAGES_PATH – Set it to %WORKSPACE%\edk2
**	EDK_TOOLS_BIN – Set it to %WORKSPACE%\edk2-BaseTools-win32
Example:
  set WORKSPACE=c:\efi\test
  set PACKAGES_PATH=%WORKSPACE%\edk2
  set EDK_TOOLS_BIN=%WORKSPACE%\edk2-BaseTools-win32
*	Run the edksetup.bat script
**	edk2\edksetup.bat
When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:
  efi
    └───test (WORKSPACE)
       ├───edk2
       ├───edk2-BaseTools-win32
       └───FatPkg

Please keep in mind that the EDK II project, FatPkg and edk2-BaseTools-win32 are independent Git repositories. Each of these repositories must be updated individually.


=='''Development Process for the EDK II Project'''==
The developer process for the EDK II project is:<BR>
#	Setup the EDK II tree if you do not have one<BR>
#	Create and checkout a topic branch for new feature or bug fix<BR>
#	Make changes in the working tree<BR>
#	Break up working tree changes into independent commits
#*       Commits should contain one logical change
#*       Commits should build / boot if possible to support use of bisect<BR>
#	Follow the commit message template given below when writing commit messages<BR>
#	Use the ‘PatchCheck.py’ script under ‘edk2\BaseTools\Scripts’ directory to verify the commits are correctly formatted<BR>
#	Update the master branch (pull or fetch/merge)<BR>
#	Rebase the topic branch onto master branch<BR>
#	Create patch (serial) to the <a href="mailto:edk2-devel-bounces@lists.01.org?Subject=Patch> edk2-devel </a> mailing list or upload the topic branch to your forked EDK II project and send the URL and branch name of the fork to the above mailing list<BR>
#*      Using ''git send-email'' is the preferred method for posting patches to the mailing list<BR>
#	Modify local commits based on the review feedbacks and repeat steps 3 to 9<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
The maintainer process for the EDK II project is:<BR>
#	Determine if a patch has met the review requirements for the package<BR>
#	Update the master branch<BR>
#	Create and checkout an integration branch<BR>
#	Integrate reviewed commits on the integration branch<BR>
#	Rebase commit message to include any reviewed-by or other attributions<BR>
#	Push changes to the EDKII project repository<BR>
#*	Pushing the integration branch directly to origin/master is preferred<BR>
