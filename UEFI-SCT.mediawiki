== UEFI SCT ==

The [[UEFI]] Self-Certification Test (UEFI SCT) is a toolset for platform developers to validate firmware implementation compliance to the UEFI Specification. The toolset features a Test Harness for executing built-in UEFI Compliance Tests, as well as for integrating user-defined tests that were developed using the UEFI SCT open source code. 

The latest version of the UEFI SCT can be found at http://uefi.org/testtools

== FWTS ==

The UEFI Board of Directors recommends the open source Firmware Test Suite (FWTS) for [[ACPI]] validation.

== UEFI PI SCT ==

The [[UEFI PI|PI]] SCT is used to perform self-certification testing on the PEI code. 

The latest Version of the PI SCT can be downloaded from: 
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/pi-sct/files/PI1.2_Sct_.2_Release_Mar_05_2013/PI1.2-SCT.2Release-Mar052013.zip/download PI1.2 SCT.2 Release.zip]

PI 1.2 introduces [[SMM]] not supported by EDK. PI SCT test cases for PI 1.2 must be built using [[EDK II]]. SCT packages for PI 1.2+ must use EDK II coding style, as EDK will not be supported from this point forward.
