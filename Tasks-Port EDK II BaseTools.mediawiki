=Task Overview=

* Difficulty: Complex
* Language: Python
* Suggested by: {{sfuser|lhauch}}
* Required completion date: End of year, 2020

Issues:
* Individual tools use shared modules that will need to be ported prior to 
  porting individual tools
* Current sources contain depricated content
* Files need to conform to the Python Coding Style Guideline and pass pylint
  (static analysis tool)
* Several standard Python module functions are overridden for handling long 
  file paths
* Several filenames are duplicated in different directory trees
* Some imports are ambiguous
  
Location of Source Code:
 [git@github.com:tianocore/edk2.git BaseTools/Source/Python]

Requirements:
* Update content to conform to Coding Style (see below)>
* Modules must pass pylint - a custom pylint RC file is available.
* Python files must start with the standard header
* Update code, replacing deprecated modules with newer modules. 
* First line python code statement in each file must be:
    <code>from __future__ import absolute_import</code>

==Tools==

* All tools are 32-bit versions of the tools, in order to create Win32 
  executables.

- Maximum line length for code: 100 characters
- Maximum line length for comments and docstrings: 72 characters
- Regular Expressions allow camel case: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]{2,30}$
- Const Regular Expressions: (([gA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)|(__.*__))$

- Python 2.7.x requires all files to be endcoded on disk as ASCII, not UTF-8.


=BaseTools Source Tree=

All modules must be able to execute from source with both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x.x
The following two files should be removed:
  Common\MigrationUtilities.py
  Common\PyUtility.pyd
