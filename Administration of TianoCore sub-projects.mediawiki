=Notes for TianoCore sub-projects=
* Enable the minimal set of 'features' on sourceforge based TianoCore sub-projects.  The more features that are enabled, the more cluttered/confusing the 'Develop' page is for for contributors.

=Mail Lists=
* Most sub-projects probably do not require separate mailing lists.  Most likely the edk or edk2 mailing lists will be sufficient for the discussion of the sub-project.
* Probably the most critical mail lists would be:
** devel: For general developer discussions
** commits: For source code commits.

* Set-up: '''Neet to document'''

=Open Discussions=

* {{sfuser|jljusten}}: We should not enable the 'forum' feature of sourceforge.  The mail lists feature seems to better match our project communication method on collabnet.
