== MinnowBoard 3 ==

MinnowBoard 3 is the follow-on to the [[MinnowBoard Max|MinnowBoardMax]] & MinnowBoard Turbot platforms. MinnowBoard platforms offer low cost & commercially available open hardware based on Intel Architecture for hardware, software and firmware developers. Hardware is expected to ship Fall 2017.

MinnowBoard is an open source hardware enabler, encouraging platform experimentation and derivative designs. The project supports [Open Source Hardware Association](http://www.oshwa.org/) principles by making designs publicly available for the community so “anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.”

MinnowBoard 3 is based on the Intel® Atom™ Processor E3900 Series processor, utilizing the Intel® Firmware Support Package (Intel® FSP) and open source UEFI from the TianoCore EDK II project. Note the source project also requires several small binary object modules, which are provided at [https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard3]

Developers can download pre-built UEFI firmware images, utilities, binary object modules, and project release notes. The open source firmware project is available from the TianoCore GitHub: [https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/devel-MinnowBoard3]
