=='''GitHub EDKII Project Repositories'''==
The EDKII project repository is available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2. 

Prebuilt Windows tools are available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32.

Please note that FatPkg is not included in the EDKII project repository, it is an independent repository which can be found at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg.

=='''How to Setup the EDKII Tree'''==
==='''Linux Support'''===
====For EDKII project developers:====
*	Clone the EDKII project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Change to the edk2 directory
*	Build the tools
**	make -C BaseTools
*	Run the edksetup.sh script
**	. edksetup.sh
When the above steps are done, you can work in the edk2 directory for code development.

====For FatPkg developers:====
*	Create a workspace directory
*	Change to the workspace directory
*	Clone the EDKII project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Clone the edk2-FatPkg repository to “FatPkg”
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg FatPkg
*	Build the tools
**	make -C edk2/BaseTools
*	Set environment variables
**	WORKSPACE – The workspace directory created above
**	PACKAGES_PATH – Set it to $WORKSPACE/edk2
Example:
  export WORKSPACE=/Sample/Path
  export PACKAGES_PATH=$WORKSPACE/edk2
*	Run the edksetup.sh script
**	. edk2/edksetup.sh
When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:
  Sample
    └───Path (WORKSPACE)
       ├───edk2
       └───FatPkg
==='''Windows Support'''===
====For EDKII project developers:====
*	Create a workspace directory
*	Change to the workspace directory
*	Clone the EDKII project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Clone the edk2-BaseTools-win32 repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32
*	Set environment variables:
**	EDK_TOOLS_BIN – Set it as the edk2-BaseTools-win32 directory
Example:
    set EDK_TOOLS_BIN=c:\efi\test\edk2-BaseTools-win32

*	Change to the edk2 directory
*	Run the edksetup.bat script
When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:
  efi
    └───test (WORKSPACE)
       ├───edk2
       └───edk2-BaseTools-win32

====For FatPkg developers:====
*	Create a workspace directory
*	Change to the workspace directory
*	Clone the EDKII project repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
*	Clone the edk2-BaseTools-win32 repository
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32
*	Clone the edk2-FatPkg repository to “FatPkg”
**	git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg FatPkg 
*	Set environment variables:
**	WORKSPACE – The workspace directory created above
**	PACKAGES_PATH – Set it to %WORKSPACE%\edk2
**	EDK_TOOLS_BIN – Set it to %WORKSPACE%\edk2-BaseTools-win32
Example:
  set WORKSPACE=c:\efi\test
  set PACKAGES_PATH=%WORKSPACE%\edk2
  set EDK_TOOLS_BIN=%WORKSPACE%\edk2-BaseTools-win32
*	Run the edksetup.bat script
**	edk2\edksetup.bat
When the above steps are done, the directory structure will look like:
  efi
    └───test (WORKSPACE)
       ├───edk2
       ├───edk2-BaseTools-win32
       └───FatPkg

Please keep in mind that the EDKII project, FatPkg and edk2-BaseTools-win32 are independent Git repositories. Each of these repositories must be updated individually.

=='''Develop Process for EDKII Project'''==
The normal develop process for EDKII project is:
#	Setup the EDKII tree if you do not have one
#	Create a topic branch for new feature or bug fix
#	Make changes in the working tree
#	Break up working tree changes into independent ones and commit them one by one to support bisect
#	Follow the commit message template given below when writing commit messages
#	Use the ‘PatchCheck.py’ script under ‘edk2\BaseTools\Scripts’ directory to verify the commits are correctly formatted
#	Update the master branch (pull or fetch/merge)
#	Rebase the topic branch onto master branch
#	Create patch (serial) to the <a href="mailto:edk2-devel-bounces@lists.01.org?Subject=Patch> edk2-devel </a> mailing list or upload the topic branch to your forked EDKII project and send the URL and branch name of the fork to the above mailing list
#	Modify local commits based on the review feedbacks and repeat steps 3 to 9
#	Update the master branch
#	Integrate reviewed commits on the topic branch to master branch
#	Push changes to the EDKII project repository
