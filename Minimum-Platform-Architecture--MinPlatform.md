The Minimum Platform Architecture (MPA) creates guidelines for how to design, enable improvements in quality and security on open source platform initialization development on firmware for Intel products.

#### MinPlatformPkg
The main MinPlatform Package ([MinPlatformPkg](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/MinPlatformPkg)) provides a consistent boot flow and well-defined interfaces to support board functions.
