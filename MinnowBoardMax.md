MinnowBoard Max & Turbot are low cost, commercially available, reference platforms for hardware, software and firmware developers who wish to work within an open environment. Design specifications and materials have been provided to the open community, encouraging platform experimentation and derivative designs.

The project is based on Intel® Atom™ processors. Technical details, schematics, and information on expansion boards (Lures) can be found at http://minnowboard.org 

A list of currently supported boards and prices can be found at: https://minnowboard.org under the "[Boards](https://minnowboard.org/compare-boards)" tab
