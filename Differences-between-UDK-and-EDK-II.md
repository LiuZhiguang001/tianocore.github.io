**Frequently asked questions about the differences between [[UDK]] i.e. [[UDK2017]] and EDK II**
  
### What is the difference between UDK and EDK II?
*	[[EDK II]] is the open source project for which volunteers (contributors) participate in development. The tip of this project is being developed and updated constantly for fixes and enhancements.
*	The [[UDK]] releases are NOT maintained by volunteer. Each UDK release is a fully validated implementation by Intel for a specific revision of the EDK II source. The latest [[UDK]] Release Notes denotes the git revision used for each of the validated [[UDK]] release.
* The [[UDK]] release contains a validated subset of the packages available from the EDK II project.

### How do other 3rd party companies use [[UDK]]?
* Other 3rd party companies, including BIOS vendors use the UEFI conformance BIOS implementation based on the UDK release which Intel validates.
*   See also the Intel UEFI community for more information https://software.intel.com/en-us/firmware/

### [[UDK]] is stable
* It is NOT “always changed.” The last release of [[UDK]] was [[UDK2017]] June 2017. 
* The NEXT release of [[UDK]] is being discussed and will include any updates those that use it have requested to be included. The release cadence will likely be, perhaps, once every six months – completely dependent upon what feedback comes in from the open source community and customers that use it.
