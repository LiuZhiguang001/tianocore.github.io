__NOTOC__
Here are some basic guidelines to help make commits easier to review and to improve the readability of the repository history.  These guidelines should also help to make sure that the use of ''git bisect'' can be used to debug issues.<BR>

==Commit Organization==
* One logical / functional change per commit
* Do not mix formatting and logical changes in the same commit
* Each commit must build and boot to support git bisect
** See ''Dealing with Bisect Issues'' below

==Dealing with Bisect Issues==
* See if reordering commits will help to keep each commit building and booting
* Adding temporary code that is removed at the end of the patch series is acceptable
* Developers are only responsible for testing the build with their preferred tool chain
