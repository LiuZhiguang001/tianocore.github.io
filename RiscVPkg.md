[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) is an open ISA which was designed to support research and education of computer architecture, but now it becomes a standard open Instruction Set Architecture for industry implementations. The RISC-V edk2 project is to create a new processor binding in UEFI spec and have the RISC-V edk2 implementation. The goal is to have RISC-V edk2 port as the firmware reference for RISC-V platforms.
RISC-V package (RiscVPkg) which provides RISC-V processor related protocols and libraries according to UEFI specification and edk2 implementations.
