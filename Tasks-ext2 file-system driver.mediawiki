Develop an [[Wikipedia:Ext2|ext2]] filesystem driver.  (read-only support would be useful as a first step)

* Difficulty: Medium ... Hard
* Language: C
* Mentor: {{sfuser|geekboy15a}}
* Suggested by: {{sfuser|rsun3}}

=Current Status=
* Being worked on by Alin Rus for [[GSOC2011]]
** Source: https://github.com/rraf/Ext2Pkg

=Details=
Filesystems in UEFI can be accessed through the SimpleFileSystem protocol.  This protocol is the defined within [https://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/edk2/trunk/edk2/MdePkg/Include/Protocol/SimpleFileSystem.h SimpleFileSystem.h].

This project should be completed with a [[BSD License]].
This would mean that GPL licenses ext2 code or header files cannot be used.
You would need to investigate ext2's disk format by looking for documentation,
consulting with ext2(+) developers, or (as a last resort) by examining the disk contents.

It may be possible to leverage [[BSD License|BSD licensed]] code from a
reputable open source project, but using 3rd-party code does add
some extra complexity (see [[Code Contributions]]).

=Development environment=
Building: This project can be completed on any edk2 supported OS or toolchain.

Testing: [http://tianocore.github.io/ovmf/ OVMF] would probably provide the easiest environment for testing your project.  You should be able to build your driver into OVMF and then run OVMF with a hard disk image that contains an ext2 file-system.

=Further Discussion=
This project would be for an edk2 based driver, so please discuss the project on [[edk2-devel]].
