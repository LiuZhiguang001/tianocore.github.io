Welcome to TianoCore, the community supporting an open source implementation of UEFI. EDK II is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and PI specifications. We hope that youâ€™ll delve into our work, use TianoCore for platform firmware, report any issues you find, and contribute to the community.

If you want to compile firmware or utilities, we recommend the [[Getting Started with EDK II]] page. This provides an overview of downloading [EDK II from github](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) and building a sample platform (NT32, OVMF, MdePkg, ...). You can also use [[UDK2015]], a stable snapshot of the EDK II project. 

There are multiple open platforms with UEFI firmware based on EDK II open source, including [MinnowBoard Max/Turbot](https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max), [MinnowBoard 3](https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard3), and [Intel Galileo Gen2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/QuarkPlatformPkg).

TianoCore uses Bugzilla to track issues and feature requests. Please review [[Reporting Issues]] and [[Reporting Security Issues]] for more information. If you would like to contribute code or fix issues, please see [[How To Contribute]].
