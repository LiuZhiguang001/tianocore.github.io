# UEFI Development Kit (UDK)

The UEFI Development Kit (UDK) is a stable release of portions of [[EDK II]]. UDK releases are tested against Intel architecture platforms, and omits components that cannot be validated on those configurations.

## Current Release: [[UDK2015]]

## Past Releases: [[UDK2014]] / [[UDK2010]] / [UDK2008](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/UDK2008)

## Differences Between UDK and EDK II

[[EDK II]] is the open source project for which volunteers participate in development. The tip of this project is constantly updated for fixes and enhancements.

[[UDK]] releases represent a fully validated implementation of a specific revision of [[EDK II source]], tested against Intel Architecture platforms. Each UDK release lists the corresponding EDK II version in the release notes. Each release is available as a ZIP file, and is mapped to a branch of the EDK II github project (example: https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/UDK2015 for [[UDK2015]]).
