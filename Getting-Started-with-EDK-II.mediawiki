=Downloading and Compiling Code=

This page shows the steps for downloading EDK II from GitHub and compiling projects under various OS/compiler environments.

==GitHub Help==

GitHub (https://help.github.com/index.html) provides step-by-step instructions for user registration and basic features supported by GitHub 

* Setup GitHub for Linux/Windows/MAC (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Download and install a git GUI interface: git GUI Clients (https://git-scm.com/download/gui/win) | TortoiseGit (https://tortoisegit.org/)

===GitHub EDK II Project Repositories===

* The EDK II project repository is available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2. 
* Prebuilt Windows tools are available at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32. 
* Please note that FatPkg is not included in the EDKII project repository, it is an independent repository which can be found at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-FatPkg.
* Content that is not released under an accepted open source license can be found at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-non-osi.<BR>

==How to Setup the EDK II Tree==

Several build environments are supported and documented.  If instructions are not available for your exact system configuration, you may still be able to tweak the instructions to work on your system.

* Linux: [[Using EDK II with Native GCC]] (recommended for current versions of Linux)
* Microsoft Windows: [[Windows systems]] (Win7/8/8.1/10)
* Mac OS X: [[Xcode]]
* UNIX: [[Unix-like systems]] (For non-Linux UNIX, older Linux distros, or when using Cygwin)

'''Note:''' Some other build tools may be required depending on the project or package:
* [[Nasm Setup|Nasm]]
* [[ASL Setup|ASL Compiler]]

'''Note:''' Some of the following examples use the [[Multiple_Workspace]] feature to configure EDK II BaseTools.

Once you have a basic build environment running, you can build a project in RELEASE or [[EDK II Debugging|DEBUG]] mode.

==EDK II Development Process==
After setting up your build environment see  [[EDK II Development Process]] for making contributions to the EDK II Project.

==Further Help==

If you have questions about the code or run into obstacles getting things to work, please join the [[edk2-devel]] email list and ask your EDK II related questions on the list.
